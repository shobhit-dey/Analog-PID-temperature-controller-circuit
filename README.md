# Analog-PID-temperature-controller-circuit
An analog electronics based PID control of temperature where the feedback is taken using a thermistor and a thermoelectric cooler(TEC) is used to heat or cool actively to a setpoint. And onboard Arduino integrated for LCD monitoring. Please read the manual named "Temperature controller circuit.pdf" added in this repository for a detailed guide.
