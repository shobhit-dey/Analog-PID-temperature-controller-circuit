# Analog-PID-temperature-controller-circuit
An analog electronics based PID control of temperature where the feedback is taken using a thermistor and a thermoelectric cooler(TEC) is used to heat or cool actively to a setpoint. And onboard Arduino integrated for LCD monitoring. Please read the manual named "temp_ctrlr_circuit.pdf" added in this repository for a detailed guide. 

Along with this, I am also adding designs for a high power regulated voltage source that would take any unregulated high voltage input(12V or 15V) from a power supply like acopian and can give a clean, high power(several amperes of current, beyond the limit of standard zeners) regulated output. Again read the "Fan power" section from the manual to learn using this circuit.
